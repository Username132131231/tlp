For those experiencing crashes in later seasons of a career, the following solutions can be tried:

✅ DEFINITIVE SOLUTION:

Transferring to Another Team and Returning:
If you have a player in the youth team you want to promote to your main team, do it before this step. Go back to your save from before the crash day, use the Live Editor to transfer to another team, and then transfer back to your original team. This resolves the crash issue.

✅ ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION 1:

Trying Again:
Restart the game and try simulating again. For some, the crash issue was fixed after re-simulating.

✅ ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION 2:

Live Editor Transfer Ban:
As mentioned earlier, make sure to take a separate save before each August. Return to the save from a week before the crash day. As shown in the video below, create a transfer ban for your club through the Live Editor from a few days before the crash day (or until the end of the transfer window if you are sure your transfers are complete). If there's no crash, you can lift the ban.

These are temporary solutions you can use to continue your career until we resolve the issue.
